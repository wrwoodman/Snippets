# Snippets
This repository is for storing any cool hacks or code snippets found in your coding journey.
Most of my work is done in C# so that is the code that will be found the most.
If you find something interesting or useful that you want to add, set up a pull request.
I don't expect this to compile as a project but the individual pieces should compile on their own.
You are free to use whatever you find here.
