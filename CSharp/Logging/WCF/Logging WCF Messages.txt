Logging WCF Messages

You want to log the contents of messages that go through your WCF service.
Start here.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1319043/how-to-get-message-content-from-system-servicemodel-channels-message/10759660#10759660

The file ServiceMessageInspector.cs implements the code found at StackExchange.
The file ServiceMessageEndpointBehavior.cs adds the behavior to the stream.
In the startup.cs file where the service is set up in the service container, do this.

            services.AddScoped<IConnectedServiceClient>(provider =>
            {
                var messageFormat = Configuration[Constants.MessageFormat];
                var uniqueIdExtractor = provider.GetService<IUniqueIdExtractor>();
                var client = new ConnectedServiceClient();
                client.Endpoint.Address = new EndpointAddress(Configuration["ConnectedServiceConfig:Endpoint"]);
                client.Endpoint.EndpointBehaviors.Add(new ServiceMessageEndpointBehavior(uniqueIdExtractor, messageFormat));
                return client;
            });

This will write the entire message out to a target.  This may contain PII data so don't do that in a  production environment.
